    purpose: "To enhance immersion and make a game world feel authentic, a language should have clear grammar and syntax rules while allowing flexibility for different contexts. It should be easy for players to learn, with phonetics that match the game's themeâ€”melodic or guttural for fantasy, and mechanical or technological for sci-fi. To evoke specific imagery or emotions, the language should use unique words and phrases that reflect the cultures or factions in the game. A complementary script or writing system can deepen the immersive experience."

    context: "Book",
    purpose: "To create a robust and believable fictional language, focus on building a comprehensive vocabulary with unique terms for concepts, objects, and places, ensuring they reflect the culture and history of the world. Include idiomatic expressions, slang, and regional variations to add depth and realism, and consider how the language has evolved through historical influences and dialects. When using this language in dialogue, do so sparingly to convey specific cultural or emotional nuances without overwhelming the reader."

    context: "Personal",
    purpose: "The language allows for flexibility, with no strict rules, enabling you to explore styles from experimental to structured. It can serve as a unique mode of self-expression, letting you design a simple or complex system based on your preference. You can also create custom scripts or symbols, adding a personal artistic touch or a secret code for private use."
