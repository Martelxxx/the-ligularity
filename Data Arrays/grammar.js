      purpose: `In this structure, word order generally follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern. The language features multiple tenses, encompassing past, present, and future, with additional distinctions for aspects like progressive and perfect. It uses definite ("the") and indefinite articles ("a", "an"). Pluralization typically involves adding "s" or "es" to the base form of nouns. Modifiers, such as adjectives, generally precede nouns, while adverbs can occupy various positions within a sentence.`

      name: "Japanese",
      purpose: `Japanese grammar typically follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order. Particles, such as "wa" for the topic and "ga" for the subject, play a crucial role in indicating grammatical relationships. The language has various politeness levels, with different verb endings and specialized vocabulary to match. Verb conjugation does not depend on person or number, but rather on tense and mood. Japanese nouns have no grammatical gender or articles, and pluralization is generally achieved through context, without changes to the noun itself.`

      name: "German",
      purpose: `The typical word order follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, but it's flexible, especially in subordinate clauses. Nouns in German come with a gender assignment—masculine, feminine, or neutral—and take definite articles such as "der", "die", or "das", and indefinite articles like "ein" or "eine." The language uses a case system where nouns, pronouns, and adjectives change forms depending on their grammatical role, whether nominative, accusative, genitive, or dative. Verbs are conjugated according to tense, person, and number. Additionally, German allows for extensive compounding, creating complex words by combining simpler ones.`

      name: "Chinese",
      purpose: `Typically follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, though its structure can be flexible in certain contexts. The language is tonal, meaning that pitch and intonation variations can change the meaning of words. Unlike many other languages, Mandarin does not use tenses or articles—verbs don't conjugate to indicate tense, and there are no definite or indefinite articles. Instead, classifiers are used with numbers to specify nouns, such as "ge" for general objects and "zhang" for flat objects. Particles play an important role, indicating aspect, posing questions, or adding emphasis to a statement.`

      name: "Arabic",
      purpose: `Typical word order is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO), although Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) is also frequently used. Definite articles are represented by "al-", with nouns having gender, either masculine or feminine. The language uses different forms for nouns and adjectives based on case, with nominative, accusative, and genitive cases being the most common. Verbs are conjugated according to tense, aspect, person, and number. The vocabulary has a root-based structure, where words derive from three-consonant roots, with specific patterns to create various forms and meanings.`

    {
      name: "Exotic",
      purpose: `The word order is Object-Subject-Verb (OSV). Verb conjugation involves adding "-na" to the verb stem for the present tense, "-do" for the past tense, and using an auxiliary verb "rek" to indicate the future tense. Noun declension is managed by the base form for the nominative case, "-ti" for the accusative case, and "-ka" for the genitive case. The plural form is created by adding "-zai" to the noun. The pronouns are "zen" for the first person, "yu" for the second person, and "go" for the third person, with a gender-neutral language that does not distinguish between genders. Prepositions include "in" for location, "on" for surface, and "at" for a specific place, while postpositions use "-su" for "with" and "-ra" for "near."`
